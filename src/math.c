/**
 * @brief Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors.
 *
 * Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors 
 * in a multi-dimensional space. It is commonly used to determine the 
 * similarity between embeddings or feature vectors.
 *
 *
 * @param v1 Pointer to the first vector (array of float32_t).
 * @param v2 Pointer to the second vector (array of float32_t).
 * @param dims The number of dimensions (size) of the vectors.
 * @return The cosine similarity value, ranging from -1 to 1.
 *
 * @note A value of `1.0` indicates identical direction, `0.0` means the vectors 
 *       are orthogonal (no similarity), and `-1.0` indicates opposite directions.
 * @note Both vectors must have the same dimensionality (`dims`).
 * @note This function assumes that the input vectors are aligned and that `dims`
 *       is a multiple of 4 for optimal SIMD performance.
 * @note If either vector has a zero magnitude, the function returns `0.0`
 *       to avoid division by zero.
